# Write Simply – Java Web Application (MSc Dissertation)

## Project Overview

Write Simply is a Java-based web application developed as part of my Master of Science dissertation in Information Technology. The application addresses the challenge of information overload and digital distraction by providing aspiring authors with a **single, distraction-free environment** for brainstorming, planning, and writing long-form creative content.

Rather than requiring users to switch between multiple tools, tabs, or platforms, Write Simply integrates **writing, plotting, character development, and visualization features** into one cohesive web application. The project demonstrates full-cycle software development using enterprise-aligned design and implementation practices.

## Problem Statement

Modern writers often rely on fragmented digital tools that interrupt creative flow and reduce productivity. Excessive context switching between platforms increases cognitive load and makes long-form writing difficult to manage effectively.

This project explores how a unified web application can reduce distractions while supporting core creative writing workflows through structured system design and integrated functionality.

## Project Objectives

The application was designed to:

- Provide a **unified text-editing and brainstorming platform** for creative writing
- Integrate **plot tracking, character development, and story visualization tools**
- Eliminate reliance on multiple platforms or browser tabs
- Support long-form writing through structured planning and progress tracking
- Improve productivity by offering a **clutter-free, focused workspace**
